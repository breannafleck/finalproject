            <h3>How We Met</h3>
            <p>
              Pacific Coast Trails was born from a friendship forged in a
              sustainability class at college. The four of us—Alex, Jordan,
              Casey, and Morgan—bonded over our love for the outdoors and spent
              weekends escaping to the wilderness whenever we could. Camping
              became our sanctuary, a break from the chaos of school and city
              life. Those early adventures taught us not only the beauty of
              nature but the importance of preserving it for future generations.

            <h3>How We Started</h3>
            <p>
              Fast forward to our 30s, and the reality of 9-to-5 jobs had set
              in—we were exhausted, uninspired, and dreaming of being back under
              the stars. We longed for the freedom of camping but craved the
              comforts of home, and that’s when the idea for Pacific Coast
              Trails was born. We combined our love for adventure with our
              passion for sustainability, creating a space where people could
              experience nature without sacrificing comfort. After years of
              planning, saving, and plenty of trial and error, our dream finally
              became a reality.

            <h3>Our Values</h3>
            <p>
              At PCT, we believe in slow living, sustainability, and
              reconnecting with nature in a meaningful way. Our goal is to
              provide an eco-friendly escape where guests can unwind, explore,
              and leave feeling more connected to the environment. We prioritize
              sustainable building materials, renewable energy, and conservation
              efforts to minimize our impact. Above all, we want PCT to be a
              place where people can embrace the outdoors without giving up the
              little comforts that make life enjoyable.
